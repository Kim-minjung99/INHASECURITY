# INHASECURITY
인하방범대(최준영, 김민정)

We need the haarcascade.xml which is in the opencv_master.zip(or just File)

so I think "WHAT about Making haarcascade.xml just fit us?"
Unfortunately, Our goal is not finding HUMAN but finding each person.
This mean is that Finding to the each person isn't need .xml file. That need another something else....

What should we do?
