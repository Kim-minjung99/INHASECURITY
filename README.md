# INHASECURITY
인하방범대(최준영, 김민정)

We need the haarcascade.xml which is in the opencv_master.zip(or just File)

so I think "WHAT about Making haarcascade.xml just fit us?"
Unfortunately, Our goal is not finding HUMAN but finding each person.
This mean is that Finding to the each person isn't need .xml file. That need another something else....

What should we do?

if you want to connect raspberry by wireless connection(as you know wireless is wifi)  
DO NOT save wifi info more than 2, BUT just save one wifi info.
In my case, my wireless type is "iptime" so if you have that same thing, connect to "192.168.0.1" page. ("192.168.0.1" is IP address that iptime is for private use.)
And check the IP address which is raspberry's.


2. if you want to more information, plz check the file where is in INHASECURITY
